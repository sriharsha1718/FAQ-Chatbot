It√ïs evident that normal data points always occur around a dense neighborhood and abnormalities deviate far away. To measure the nearest set of a data point, you can use Euclidean distance or similar measure according to the type of data you have.   \n",

Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds of k-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIn k-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into k equally (or nearly equally) sized segments or folds. Subsequently k iterations of training and validation are performed such that within each iteration a different fold of the data is held-out for validation while the remaining k ? 1 folds are used for learning. \\n\\nSo, why do we use cross-validation?\\n\\nIt allows us to get more metrics and draw important conclusion about our algorithm and our data.\\n\\nHelps to tune the hyper parameters of a given machine learning algorithm, to get good performance according to some suitable metric.\\n\\nIt mitigates overfitting while building a pipeline of models, such that second√ïs models input will be real predictions on data that our first model never seen before.\\n\\nK-fold cross validation also significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.   \n",

              "103  \\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon\\n\\nIntroduction\\nArtificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are inspired by the working of the Human Neuron. It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron?\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons?\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions?\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks?\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function   \n",

It√ïs evident that normal data points always occur around a dense neighborhood and abnormalities deviate far away. To measure the nearest set of a data point, you can use Euclidean distance or similar measure according to the type of data you have.  \n",

Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds of k-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIn k-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into k equally (or nearly equally) sized segments or folds. Subsequently k iterations of training and validation are performed such that within each iteration a different fold of the data is held-out for validation while the remaining k ? 1 folds are used for learning. \\n\\nSo, why do we use cross-validation?\\n\\nIt allows us to get more metrics and draw important conclusion about our algorithm and our data.\\n\\nHelps to tune the hyper parameters of a given machine learning algorithm, to get good performance according to some suitable metric.\\n\\nIt mitigates overfitting while building a pipeline of models, such that second√ïs models input will be real predictions on data that our first model never seen before.\\n\\nK-fold cross validation also significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.  \n",

              "103  \\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon\\n\\nIntroduction\\nArtificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are inspired by the working of the Human Neuron. It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron?\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons?\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions?\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks?\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function  \n",

It√ïs evident that normal data points always occur around a dense neighborhood and abnormalities deviate far away. To measure the nearest set of a data point, you can use Euclidean distance or similar measure according to the type of data you have.   \n",

Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds of k-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIn k-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into k equally (or nearly equally) sized segments or folds. Subsequently k iterations of training and validation are performed such that within each iteration a different fold of the data is held-out for validation while the remaining k ? 1 folds are used for learning. \\n\\nSo, why do we use cross-validation?\\n\\nIt allows us to get more metrics and draw important conclusion about our algorithm and our data.\\n\\nHelps to tune the hyper parameters of a given machine learning algorithm, to get good performance according to some suitable metric.\\n\\nIt mitigates overfitting while building a pipeline of models, such that second√ïs models input will be real predictions on data that our first model never seen before.\\n\\nK-fold cross validation also significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.   \n",

              "103  \\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon\\n\\nIntroduction\\nArtificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are inspired by the working of the Human Neuron. It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron?\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons?\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions?\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks?\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function   \n",

It√ïs evident that normal data points always occur around a dense neighborhood and abnormalities deviate far away. To measure the nearest set of a data point, you can use Euclidean distance or similar measure according to the type of data you have.   \n",

Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds of k-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIn k-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into k equally (or nearly equally) sized segments or folds. Subsequently k iterations of training and validation are performed such that within each iteration a different fold of the data is held-out for validation while the remaining k ? 1 folds are used for learning. \\n\\nSo, why do we use cross-validation?\\n\\nIt allows us to get more metrics and draw important conclusion about our algorithm and our data.\\n\\nHelps to tune the hyper parameters of a given machine learning algorithm, to get good performance according to some suitable metric.\\n\\nIt mitigates overfitting while building a pipeline of models, such that second√ïs models input will be real predictions on data that our first model never seen before.\\n\\nK-fold cross validation also significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.   \n",

              "103  \\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon\\n\\nIntroduction\\nArtificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are inspired by the working of the Human Neuron. It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron?\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons?\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions?\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks?\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function   \n",

It√ïs evident that normal data points always occur around a dense neighborhood and abnormalities deviate far away. To measure the nearest set of a data point, you can use Euclidean distance or similar measure according to the type of data you have.  \n",

Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds of k-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIn k-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into k equally (or nearly equally) sized segments or folds. Subsequently k iterations of training and validation are performed such that within each iteration a different fold of the data is held-out for validation while the remaining k  1 folds are used for learning. \\n\\nSo, why do we use cross-validation\\n\\nIt allows us to get more metrics and draw important conclusion about our algorithm and our data.\\n\\nHelps to tune the hyper parameters of a given machine learning algorithm, to get good performance according to some suitable metric.\\n\\nIt mitigates overfitting while building a pipeline of models, such that second√ïs models input will be real predictions on data that our first model never seen before.\\n\\nK-fold cross validation also significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.  \n",

              "103  \\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon\\n\\nIntroduction\\nArtificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are inspired by the working of the Human Neuron. It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function  \n",

It√ïs evident that normal data points always occur around a dense neighborhood and abnormalities deviate far away. To measure the nearest set of a data point, you can use Euclidean distance or similar measure according to the type of data you have.   \n",

Other forms of cross-validation are special cases of k-fold cross-validation or involve repeated rounds of k-fold cross-validation.\\n\\nIn k-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into k equally (or nearly equally) sized segments or folds. Subsequently k iterations of training and validation are performed such that within each iteration a different fold of the data is held-out for validation while the remaining k ? 1 folds are used for learning. \\n\\nSo, why do we use cross-validation?\\n\\nIt allows us to get more metrics and draw important conclusion about our algorithm and our data.\\n\\nHelps to tune the hyper parameters of a given machine learning algorithm, to get good performance according to some suitable metric.\\n\\nIt mitigates overfitting while building a pipeline of models, such that second√ïs models input will be real predictions on data that our first model never seen before.\\n\\nK-fold cross validation also significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.   \n",

              "103  \\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon\\n\\nIntroduction\\nArtificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are inspired by the working of the Human Neuron. It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron?\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons?\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions?\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks?\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function   \n",

It is the backbone of Deep Learning that led to the achievement of bigger milestones in almost all the fields thereby bringing an evolution in which we approach a problem.\\n\\nTherefore it becomes necessary for every aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer to have a good knowledge of these Neural Networks.\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss the most important questions on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which is helpful to get you a clear understanding of the techniques, and also for Data Science Interviews, which covers its very fundamental level to complex concepts.\\n\\nLet√ïs get started,\\n1. What do you mean by Perceptron?\\nA perceptron also called an artificial neuron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features.\\n\\nIt is a single-layer neural network used as a linear classifier while working with a set of input data. Since perceptron uses classified data points which are already labeled, it is a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is used to enable neurons to learn and process elements in the training set one at a time.\\n\\nDeep Learning Interview Questions 4 | Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\nImage Source: Google Images\\n\\n2. What are the different types of Perceptrons?\\nThere are two types of perceptrons:\\n\\n1. Single-Layer Perceptrons\\n\\nSingle-layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns.\\n\\n2. Multilayer Perceptrons\\n\\nMultilayer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks having two or more layers have a higher processing power.\\n\\n3. What is the use of the Loss functions?\\nThe loss function is used as a measure of accuracy to identify whether our neural network has learned the patterns accurately or not with the help of the training data.\\nThis is completed by comparing the training data with the testing data.\\n\\nTherefore, the loss function is considered as a primary measure for the performance of the neural network. In Deep Learning, a good-performing neural network will have a low value of the loss function at all times when training happens.\\n\\n4. What is the role of the Activation functions in Neural Networks?\\nThe reason for using activation functions in Neural Networks are as follows:\\n\\n1. The idea behind the activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network so that it can learn more complex functions.\\n\\n2. Without the Activation function, the neural network behaves as a linear classifier, learning the function which is a linear combination of its input data.\\n\\n3. The activation function converts the inputs into outputs.\\n\\n4. The activation function is responsible for deciding whether a neuron should be activated i.e, fired or not.\\n\\n5. To make the decision, firstly it calculates the weighted sum and further adds bias with it.\\n\\n6. So, the basic purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\\n\\n5. List down the names of some popular Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.\\nSome of the popular activation functions that are used while building the deep learning models are as follows:\\nSigmoid function\\nHyperbolic tangent function\\nRectified linear unit (RELU) function\\nLeaky RELU function\\nMaxout function\\nExponential Linear unit (ELU) function</td>\n",
